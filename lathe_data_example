# Lathe data listing. Data here is valid for my MW210V 8x39.
# Parameter order doesn't matter, any parameters given on the command line
# will override the ones provided here.
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THE VARIABLE NAMES.
# DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMAT!
# DO NOT PROVIDE 'EMPTY' PARAMETERS (i.e., a name without a value).
#
# IMPORTANT: ALL THE PARAMETERS HERE ARE REQUIRED!!!
#
# NOTE: spindle_diameter, leadscrew_diameter, max_centers, min_out_dim, and
# gear_clearance are 'equivalent sizes', that is to say, they are the number
# of teeth a gear of the same dimension as the desired dimension would have.
# They SHOULD be given as integers--gears don't have fractional teeth.
# The ONLY decimal figures here should be metric pitches. Yes, 2-4 1/2, I know.
# If you know about modules and gears, you know what I'm talking about.
# If you don't, GTS, you're about to run a lathe, aren't you?
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# There are four possible gear configurations on the MW210:
#
# 'H' designates a spacer bushing, or just a small gear that won't interfere,
# '|' designates meshing, '-' designates a gearpost, and '=' designates the
# leadscrew. 'S' is the (fixed) spindle gear.

# A-H    A-B     A-H     A-B      There is only one possible population
# |        |     |         |      with 3 or 5 gears (I and IV);there are two
# C-H    H-D     C-D     C-D      possibilities with 4 (II and III).
# |        |       |     |        I call II the 'dogleg' and III the 'flash'.

# LEGEND:
# pitch_unit             -- Unit ('mm' or 'tpi') of the desired pitches.
# spindle_teeth          -- Fixed drive gear on spindle.
# spindle_diameter       -- How much space is taken up by the spindle*.
# leadscrew_pitch        -- Leadscrew pitch.
# leadscrew_unit         -- mm, unless you found/made an imperial leadscrew...
# leadscrew_diameter     -- How much space is taken up by the shaft**.
# max_centers            -- Max center distance of gear mounting posts.
# min_out_dim            -- Min outside dimension (so A touches the spindle).
# gear_clearance         -- With both posts fully occupied, i.e. 5 gears used,
#                           clearance between the non-meshing gears A and C.
# gears_output_file      -- Output file name.
# output_format          -- Output format, 'layout' prints only the best gear
#                           sets like on the lathe gear table, 'list' prints
#                           ALL zero-error gear sets in a more compact fashion,
#                           as well as the nearset smaller and larger results
#                           of pitches that cannot achieve zero error.
# check_set_output_file  -- Output file name when using the -c option.
#
# NOTES:
# *  The spindle limits the size of the 'B' gear. This dimension is
#    essentially the number of teeth a gear matching the diameter of the
#    spindle would have. Ish. This value should include a safety margin.
# ** The leadscrew limits the size of the gear paired with its meshing gear on
#    the bottom gear post. This dimension is essentially the number of teeth a
#    gear matching the diameter of the shaft would have. Ish. This value
#    should include a safety margin.
