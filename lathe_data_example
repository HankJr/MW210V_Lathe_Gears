# Lathe data listing. Data here is valid for my MW210V 8x39.
# Be careful adding gears, possibilities grow exponentially,
# 25 gears give about 1.25 BILLION possibilities...
# Here's a graph. <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cpiettwsy2>
# Parameter order doesn't matter. Not all parameters need
# to be here, but those that are will override the ones in
# the program file. Any parameters given on the command line
# will override both the ones in the program file, as well as
# the ones provided here.
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THE VARIABLE NAMES.
# DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMAT!
# DO NOT PROVIDE 'EMPTY' PARAMETERS (i.e., a name without a value).
#
# Pitch and leadscrew unit options are: mm, tpi.
#
# NOTE: spindle_diameter, leadscrew_diameter, max_centers, and
# gear_clearance are 'equivalent sizes', that is to say, they are
# the number of teeth a gear of the same dimension as the desired
# dimension would have. If you know about modules and gears you know
# what I'm talking about. If you don't, GTS, you're about to run
# a lathe, aren't you?
